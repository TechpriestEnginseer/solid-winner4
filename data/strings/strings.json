For the Fourteenth Battlegroup, a variant equipped with a pair of standard TPCs was developed and although it was dismissed by Domain Navy for impracticality due to requiring the sacrifice of two of its medium-sized weapon mounts to make room for the additional hardware and supplementary power generators, it was well-loved by some of the battlegroup's higher-ups. The constructions plans were finally recovered in the Persean Sector and returned to its rightful owner, its variants went into production to strike fear into the enemies of its owner.\n\n Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems. These issues aside, however, the performance of the Castigator is without question impressive. Combining heavy armor, numerous weapon mounts and adequate maneuverability in a heavy cruiser package designed to fight at the frontlines of any battle. Charging into combat with its visually spectacular Assault Burn, the Castigator is an awe-inspiring sight to behold and an enemy most would prefer to avoid facing head-on.", #if castigator xiv is found and returned, hegemony and iron shell will access this ship now
