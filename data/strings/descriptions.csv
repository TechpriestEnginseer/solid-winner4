#Fighters with codex entries,,,,,
eis_peacekeeper,SHIP,"The Peacekeeper is an advanced space superiority interceptor design in use by Iron Shell. Armed with a downscaled Devastator Cannon as well as a pair of anti-fighter missile launchers, this particular interceptor excels against enemy fighters. Due to their Delta-level AI processing core being fine-tuned for targeting and hunting enemy fighters, Peacekeepers become much less effective against conventional warships as they do not have enough processing power to deal critical damage. 

The Peacekeeper interceptor is an infrequent sight in Iron Shell fleets due to a multitude of reasons; they require that a single highly-skilled pilot directly interface with the fighter's Delta-level AI, something that very few human pilots are willing to do in the wake of the great AI Wars. Furthermore, long-term use of the AI synchronization system has been shown to cause mental instability in some pilots, having grown so accustomed to their link with the AI subprocessor that they struggle to make sense of reality without it. In the wake of these problems, mandatory weekly flight hour limtations were instated to allow Peacekeeper pilots time to reacclimate. Lastly, Luddic pilots are not even given the option to command such a fighter, to prevent political issues with the Luddic Church. Because of these circumstances, piloting the Peacekeeper is a choice offered only to the best of the best pilots that the Hegemony can offer, making those brave (or foolish) enough to pilot the fighter a rare commodity indeed.",,,
eis_dagger,SHIP,"A prototype precursor to what is now known as the ""Dagger"" torpedo bomber. This XIV variant utilizes a modified Hammer torpedo that has both a larger, more unstable payload, as well as a point-defense screen of light Annihilator rockets that are launched as the Hammer approaches its target. It also has a higher damage potential than conventional Dagger bombers, at the cost of tracking ability.

An experimental predecessor to the Dagger Atropos bomber commissioned by high-ranking Fourteenth Battlegroup commanders, the Dagger (XIV) was beset by a myriad of technical issues that ultimately resulted in the bomber being unused until its more successful high-tech variant was perfected during the Mastery Epoch. The Hammer torpedos had a tendency to drift off course of their intended target, and initial prototypes of the Annihilator PD screen proved to be unreliable at best. Although few forge templates were ever made for the Dagger prototype, one eventually found its way in to the hands of an enterprising Iron Shell engineer, who promptly set to work trying to fix the defective bomber. Only through sheer persistence did this engineer manage to correct the numerous problems plaguing the prototype; at long last the experimental bomber was ready for use by the Hegemony, being quickly adopted by Iron Shell carrier battlegroup commanders, who valued the incredible power of the bomber's Hammer torpedo compared to the less.. refined bombers typical to Hegemony fleets.",,,

eis_vengeance,SHIP,"Designed with one purpose in mind, the first Vengeance class ships were deployed in decisive engagements against massive fleets of rogue Domain Explorarium drones, turned against the Domain by an opponent lost to history. The Vengeance is equipped with an unusual set of subsystems known collectively as the ‘Vengeance Core’, allowing the ship to create concussive blasts that can deflect missiles and send them straight back at the enemy, while reinforcing its own shield in the process. This, combined with its two flight decks, drones, and generous main armament make the Vengeance stand as an exemplary counter to the supreme missile-heavy fleets of old, as well as any post-Collapse commanders that become too missile-happy for the Hegemony’s liking.",,,
eis_indomitable,SHIP,"The Indomitable-class cruiser was designed to be a more agile, offensively-oriented companion to the Dominator. While it may lack the former's staying power, it can still take quite a beating with careful use of the its rampage drive, a combination of a dampening field and a shortened activation of a burn drive.",,,
eis_endeavor,SHIP,"Proponents of newer schools of thought in the Domain’s ‘decisive battle’ doctrine heavily criticized the Legion for being too specialized and inflexible in its role. After years of heated debate, these criticisms lead directly to the commissioning of the Endeavor class of battlecarriers as a derivative of an older prototype version of the Legion. Sporting significantly increased baseline engine performance, a Jump Thruster system for versatile mobility, and a compact missile microforge, the Endeavor is much more suited to extended frontline engagements than its lumbering counterpart. What it gains in speed and endurance, it sacrifices in armor plating and fighter bay capacity.",,,
eis_tyrant,SHIP,"The Tyrant-class fast battleship is considered by some to be ahead of its time, having been developed in the late Mastery epoch - long before the Domain's adoption of more nimble capital designs such as the Conquest and Odyssey battlecruisers. Although generally scorned by naval commanders of the era in favor of the much more heavily armed and armored Onslaught, the aptly named 'Tyrant' was put to use in a number of engagements against anti-Domain rebel groups on the galactic fringe and developed a reputation in certain circles as a fearsome, if rarely deployed, combatant.",,,

#Ships with codex entries,,,,,
eis_valorous,SHIP,"An extremely advanced frigate design, that, while expensive to manufacture and deploy, has unrivaled effectiveness against most types of vessels. The Valorous is incredibly fast and powerful for a ship of its size, due to its Zandatsu mobility system and twin medium hardpoints. The only factors keeping the terrifying potential this frigate in check are its relative fragility and the skill of its pilot.

The Valorous owes its daunting combat ability due to a myriad of highly-specialized systems, the foremost of which are refered to as the ""Zandatsu Subsystems"". Iron Shell officials have publicly stated that the ship utilizes an array of Delta level AI cores; how their engineers were able to work past the lack of computational power apparent to Delta AIs and other problems inherent to multi-core AI clusters remains to be seen.

The creation of the Valorous is shrouded in mystery, for such an advance vessel, there is precious little information available regarding it. What is known seems to suggest that the Valorous is a pre-Collapse prototype that was never properly developed, due to an abundance of issues that were only recently solved by Iron Shell's research and development division. Earlier attempts by Hegemony engineers resulted in two individuals being incarcerated on the world of Yami for attempting to utilize a Gamma level AI core in the ship; these attempts failed as even the computational power of the Gamma AI proved to be insufficient to deal with the complexities of the Zandatsu systems.

Few of these vessels exist at any given moment, and it is rarer still to encounter a pilot skilled enough to utilize one to its full potential. Pilots are typically esteemed Peacekeeper interceptor aces, which is because the Valorous is operated on a similar principle; the pilot must neurally interface with the ship's AI to pilot the vessel. The AI handles mundane things such as shield and targeting solution optimizations, managing the vessel's two Gunblade drones, multiple minor subsystems, and lastly, use of the Zandatsu systems.",,,
eis_courageous,SHIP,"A fast, aggressive frigate that excels at dueling ships of similar size, the Courageous is entirely forward-focused and has to rely on its agility and drones for point defense. Its powerful thrusters and versatile Gunblade drones are invaluable in combat, though it is more expensive to deploy and service than typical frigates.

Built as a response to the widespread adoption of Centurions by rebels, Courageous-class frigates are able to use their speed to set the terms of engagement and have the weapons complement to overpower most other frigates. The Hegemony prizes its integrated Gunblade drones, which serve a similar role to the infamous Terminators without having to deal with their potentially-dangerous AIs and the rumors around them.",,,
eis_champion,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful weapons; the crowning element is a heavy hybrid turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust power grid capable of supercharging the ship's weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash crippling strikes without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.

The first time a Hegemony officer laid eyes on a Champion was at the start of the AI wars. The powerful heavy cruiser was a formidable opponent, and the seeming introduction of a new ship into the Persean Sector was cause for alarm; while the cruiser itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the possibility of the League being able to develop new warships prompted an immediate investigation. Reading in to the history of the vessel, Hegemony officials became convinced that they had been cheated, that the Champion had been meant for the 14th Battlegroup, its plans, rightfully theirs. A sense of wounded pride developed in the officers, growing into a wave of revanchism that reached its peak when several of the cruisers were recovered after a battle with the Persean League. The ambitious officers concocted a plan to reclaim what they believed to be their stolen glory. The design was upgraded with salvaged Fourteenth Battlegroup material and modified to better fit Hegemony naval doctrine; in particular, the ship's turrets and subsystems were modified to support a wider array of weaponry. Bedecked in Fourteenth Battlegroup livery, the retrofitted Champion is designed to show the Hegemony's best days are not behind it.",,,
eis_skyrend,SHIP,"The Skysplitter-class battlecruiser is a technologically-advanced warship investing heavily in frontal firepower. Inspired by the Sunder-class destroyer, the Skysplitter was initially developed by Red Monarch Starworks as a cruiser, meant to shore up some of the weaknesses of the Sunder-class. As more and more weaknesses were ""solved"", the project's scope rapidly crept out of control, resulting in an expansive list of features which could only fit in a capital-scale hull. Overall, the project culminated in a surprisingly nimble, heavily armed, and powerful ship capable of delivering exceptional firepower against any who would oppose it.

However, these strengths would come with a cost. Maintaining the Skysplitter's high speed within its size category would require reducing its armor to a relatively frail shell. The weapon overcharge system became mutually exclusive to more efficient and flexible shielding systems. Extensive and expensive automation had to be integrated in nearly every facet the ship's operation in order to offset the extended crew requirements of two hangar bays. Perhaps most damning of all, scope creep and compromise after compromise in the Skysplitter's development would lead to the project budget being extended far beyond its limits. While the Skysplitter-class has since proven itself, in its time the class's high unit cost and unproven status led to a limited inventory being adopted.

The few ships of this class which have made their way into the Persean sector have nonetheless performed admirably under pressure. Production of the hulls is still limited, but those few which circulate are coveted as truly fearsome battlecruisers.",,,

eis_fluxthrower,WEAPON,"A colossal prototype energy weapon, demanding the majority of the Tyrant's length to accommodate. The so-called ""Flux Thrower"" slowly stores accumulated flux in special capacitors before unleashing a lethal stream of superheated electroplasma. Increased damage and venting at higher flux levels. Incapable of venting hard flux.

While now used as a weapon, the Flux Thrower was originally built into Tyrant as an attempt to circumvent the limitations of flux cores of the time - the ship's heavy armor plating and structural skeleton served to bottleneck its flux venting. To compensate, several massive capacitors were linked directly to the flux core, which would vent through a large, dedicated port more rapidly than the ship could through traditional, distributed venting. While the system would never catch on, due to the space required and concerns about creating a structural weakness, it was retained in some Tyrants because it would be difficult to remove, and in time their crews would come to appreciate its terrifying effectiveness as an impromptu weapon.",,,
