ironshell,FACTION,"The Iron Shell is a military division of the Hegemony, responsible for collecting tariffs and administering the official Hegemony tax code. It is part of the Ministry of Commerce where its duties are to provide tax relief to tax dissidents; pursuing and resolving instances of tax evasions and overseeing various programs, including the AI Inspection Regulations and XIV Armor Reclamation Initiative.

Since its establishment, the Iron Shell are responsible for collecting most of the revenue needed to fund Hegemony albeit facing controversies and opposition over its methods, legality, and the principle of taxation in the Persean Sector. During the Askonia Crisis, the division struggled with budget cuts and reduced morale given the creation of the Sindrian Diktat. Nonetheless, during the Second AI War, the division collected more than $2.1 trillion worth of credits.

With a credit surplus in the budget, the Iron Shell spends lavishly to spare no expenses in a future plan to bring the Iron Shell back to her former glory.",,,
planet_chitagupta_ironshell,CUSTOM,"Chitagupta is ironically famous for its recreational facilities and resorts, which exclusively host the big-personality officers of the Hegemony and Iron Shell who seeks a respite from their strenuous duties. Common citizens can still use and access these first rate amenities, that is if they can afford the exorbitant price. On its vast endless ocean, sprawling arcologies gloriously resting above. The beating heart of Iron Shell administration is located at the centermost part of metropolitan; a wide array of formidable planetary defenses swirl around its vicinity, ever protecting it from hostile forces.",,"The watery surface of this azure planet is the byproduct of relentless bombardment from distant past. Its original icy hell nature gradually melts over decades due to the unprecedented greenhouse effect produced from the horrible aftermath. It is now teeming with undersea lifeforms by the import of sealife from Jangala. On its vast endless ocean, sprawling arcologies gloriously resting above. The beating heart of Iron Shell administration is located at the centermost part of metropolitan; a wide array of formidable planetary defenses swirl around its vicinity, ever protecting it from hostile forces.",
planet_yami_ironshell,CUSTOM,"The moon served as evidence for one of the Sector's AM fuel production facilities with its volatiles resources proving valuable to mine and export to Nachiketa for production. Under recent new management of Iron Shell from hegemony control, the frozen celestial body serves as a penal colony for political dissidents, criminals, and elusive tax evaders. A majority of them struggle in serving their sentence as the chilly, cramped mines of Yami constantly wears at their physical body. There are some who manage to escape the prisons only finding out that there is no escaping the moon itself under planetary security.",,"Despite the desolate appearance from the outside, Yami's subterranean dwellings has a bustling designated market block that welcomes the trader and high profile patrons coming from the starport. In some occasion, the prison wardens hold an auction for high-valued prisoners or those talented enough to be useful for someone with fattened pockets, regardless of purpose or reason.",

eis_xyphos,SHIP,"The XIV Battlegroup took this highly effective support wing and armed it with ballistic weapons giving them an affordable cost for their strength. A unique fighter in contrast to the already unique regular grade of Xyphos, its ballistic weapon enable a large firepower to protect its carrier from other wings and bombers as well as deal adequate damage to nearby enemy ships without their shields.",,,
eis_kopis,SHIP,"Nimble and equipped, the Kopis deals crippling damage to poorly-shielded targets, leaving permanent damage on its own if not shot down.",,,
eis_khopesh,SHIP,"The Khopesh can deliver a suppressing rocket barrage to its target. Much safer and more reliable in dealing its damage than other bombers, it uses a weaker arsenal of annihilator rockets to press on.",,,
eis_dagger,SHIP,"Armed with the Iron Hammer, the regular Dagger may be fragile, but the Dagger used in the XIV used an alternative weaponry of the Iron Hammer that sacrificed some firepower and manuvering of the regular torpedo for a missile distraction that would distract PD systems and drones.",,,
eis_audacious,SHIP,??? Unsure what to write for this yet until I make the hullmod.,,,
eis_vengeance,SHIP,"A survivor of the original 14th Domain Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony, this ship is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's 'decisive battle' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology. The Vengeance was designed as a deciding blow against a foreign entity fought during the early Domain's cycles that amassed one of the strongest resistance through their specialties of missiles and turning the Domain drones which were mainly equipped with missiles against the Domain. With an experimental core inside the ship, the ship would use its venting system to create a propulsion blast that would deflect missiles away from their ship brethrens while being able to take the bulk of the damage.",,,
eis_champion,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful weapons; the crowning element is a heavy hybrid turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust power grid capable of supercharging the ship's weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash a crippling strikes without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line. The first time a Hegemony officer laid eyes on a Champion was at the start of the AI wars. The powerful heavy cruiser was a formidable opponent, and the seeming introduction of a new ship into the Persean Sector was cause for alarm; while the cruiser itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the possibility of the League being able to develop new warships prompted an immediate investigation. Reading in to the history of the vessel, Hegemony officials became convinced that they had been cheated, that the Champion had been meant for the 14th Battlegroup, its plans, rightfully theirs. A sense of wounded pride developed in the officers, growing into a wave of revanchism that reached its peak when several of the cruisers were recovered after a battle with the Persean League. The ambitious officers concocted a plan to reclaim what they believed to be their stolen glory. The design was upgraded with salvaged Fourteenth Battlegroup material and modified to better fit Hegemony naval doctrine; in particular, the ship's turrets and subsystems were modified to support a wider array of weaponry. Bedecked in Fourteenth Battlegroup livery, the retrofitted Champion is designed to show the Hegemony's best days are not behind it.",,,
eis_endeavor,SHIP,"A survivor of the original 14th Domain Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony, this ship is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's 'decisive battle' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology. The proponents of the 'Cruiser School' who criticized the Legion for being too insufficiently specialized in its role praised the Endeavor instead which had lesser cost and greater flexibility in battle. The Endeavor mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons as well as hangar-space to field multiple fighter wings.",,,
eis_dauntless,SHIP,"A survivor of the original 14th Domain Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony, this ship is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's 'decisive battle' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical structural modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology. As the Onslaught was deployed to destroy rebels who would prefer to fight face-on, the Dauntless was deployed to destroy guerilla forces who were smart enough to avoid engagement involving the Onslaught. The Dauntless was designed in-mind to focus on the enemy's mobilities as their weakness. Rebels across the Domain who has never seen this ship would soon realize the true potential of its firepower through its ability to manuever and even ram into the enemy's ship head-on into destruction and survive. Few would survive to ever tell the tale of the Dauntless vessels flying in the Sector once more.",,,
