ironshell,FACTION,"The Iron Shell is a military division of the Hegemony, responsible for collecting tariffs and administering the official Hegemony tax code. Part of the Ministry of Commerce where its duties lies in providing tax ""relief"" to tax dissidents; pursuing and resolving instances of tax evasions and overseeing various programs, including the AI Inspection Regulations and XIV Armor Reclamation Initiative.

Since its establishment, the Iron Shell are responsible for collecting most of the revenue needed to fund Hegemony albeit facing controversies and opposition over its methods, legality, and the principle of taxation in a post-Collapse Sector. During the Askonia Crisis, the division struggled with traitors and reduced morale from the creation of the Sindrian Diktat. Nonetheless, during the Second AI War, the division collected trillions worth of credits to refund the next Hegemony's warfleet upgrades.

With a credit surplus in the budget, the Iron Shell spends lavishly to spare no expenses in a future plan to bring the Iron Shell back to her former glory.",,,
planet_chitagupta_ironshell,CUSTOM,"The watery surface of this azure planet is the byproduct of relentless bombardment from distant past. Its original icy hell nature gradually melts over decades due to the unprecedented greenhouse effect produced from the horrible aftermath. It is now teeming with undersea lifeforms by the import of sealife from Jangala.

Sprawling arcologies gloriously rests above the beating heart of Iron Shell; a wide array of formidable planetary defenses swirl around its vicinity protecting it from hostile forces.",,"Dubbed as a gleaming cerulean haven in the unforgiving space of Naraka. The presence of Iron Shell provides additional security and food to the colonies of Naraka. This planet is famous for its recreational facilities and resorts, which is exclusively available for the big-personalities of Hegemony seeking a respite from their strenuous duties. Common citizens can still use and access these first rate amenities, that is if they can afford the exorbitant price.",
planet_yami_ironshell,CUSTOM,"Despite the desolate appearance from the outside, Yami's subterranean dwellings have a bustling designated market block that welcomes the trader and high profile patrons coming from the starport. In some occasion, the prison wardens hold an auction for high-valued prisoners or those talented enough to be useful for someone with fattened pockets, regardless of purpose or reason.",,"Under the new Iron Shell administration established by the Hegemony, the frozen celestial body serves as a penal colony for political dissidents, criminals, and elusive tax evaders.

A majority of them struggle in serving their sentence as the chilly, cramped mines of Yami constantly wears at their physical body. There are some who manage to escape the prisons only to find out that there is no escaping the moon itself under planetary security.",

eis_audacious,SHIP,"Audacious-class destroyer are designed for escort duty for the Vengeance-class cruisers. When used, the ship is usually the defender of the cruiser and is used to underpin vital operations under Vengeance command. Under Vengeance command, the ship's relay reserves a coordinated maneuver increase in speed and performing time. Due to its versatility, the vessel also serves quite a few roles.

eis_vengeance,SHIP,"The Vengeance was designed as a deciding blow against a foreign entity fought during the early Domain's cycles that amassed one of the strongest resistance through their specialties of missiles and turning the Domain drones which were mainly equipped with missiles against the Domain. With an experimental core inside the ship, the ship would calculate its venting system to create a propulsion blast that would deflect missiles away from their ship brethrens while being able to take the bulk of the damage.

eis_champion,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful weapons; the crowning element is a heavy hybrid turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust power grid capable of supercharging the ship's weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash crippling strikes without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.

The first time a Hegemony officer laid eyes on a Champion was at the start of the AI wars. The powerful heavy cruiser was a formidable opponent, and the seeming introduction of a new ship into the Persean Sector was cause for alarm; while the cruiser itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the possibility of the League being able to develop new warships prompted an immediate investigation. Reading in to the history of the vessel, Hegemony officials became convinced that they had been cheated, that the Champion had been meant for the 14th Battlegroup, its plans, rightfully theirs. A sense of wounded pride developed in the officers, growing into a wave of revanchism that reached its peak when several of the cruisers were recovered after a battle with the Persean League. The ambitious officers concocted a plan to reclaim what they believed to be their stolen glory. The design was upgraded with salvaged Fourteenth Battlegroup material and modified to better fit Hegemony naval doctrine; in particular, the ship's turrets and subsystems were modified to support a wider array of weaponry. Bedecked in Fourteenth Battlegroup livery, the retrofitted Champion is designed to show the Hegemony's best days are not behind it.",,,
eis_endeavor,SHIP,"The proponents of the 'Cruiser School' who criticized the Legion for being too insufficiently specialized in its role praised the Endeavor instead which had lesser cost and greater flexibility in battle. The Endeavor mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons as well as hangar-space to field multiple fighter wings.

eis_dauntless,SHIP,"As the Dauntless  was deployed to destroy rebels who would prefer to fight face-on, the Dauntless  was deployed to destroy guerilla forces who were smart enough to avoid engagement involving the Onslaught. Designed in-mind to use the enemy's mobility  as their weakness. Rebels across the Domain who has never seen this ship would soon realize the true potential of its firepower through its ability to manuever and even ram into the enemy's ship head-on into destruction and survive. Few would survive to ever tell the tale of the Dauntless vessels flying in the Sector once more.

eis_tyrant,SHIP,"The Tyrant-class fast battleship is considered by some to be ahead of its time, having been developed in the late Mastery epoch - long before the Domain's later adoption of fast capital designs such as the Conquest- and Odyssey-class battlecruisers. Although generally scorned by naval commanders of the era in favor of the much more heavily armed and armored Onslaught, the aptly named 'Tyrant' was put to use in a number of engagements against anti-Domain rebel groups on the galactic fringe and developed a reputation as a fearsome - if still infrequently deployed - combatant.
