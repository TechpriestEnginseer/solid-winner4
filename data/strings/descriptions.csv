ironshell,FACTION,"Iron Shell is a military division of the Hegemony Ministry of Commerce founded by charter after the Second AI War. They are responsible for collecting tariffs and administering the official Hegemony tax code. As part of the Ministry of Commerce, Iron Shell's duty lies in pursuing and resolving instances of tax evasion, as well as overseeing various programs, including the AI Inspection Regulations and the XIV Battlegroup Material Reclamation Initiative.

Since its establishment, the Iron Shell has been responsible for the collection and administration of all Hegemony funding and financial assets. It has, however, faced numerous controversies concerning its methods, their legality, and the principle of taxation in a post-Collapse sector. During the Askonia Crisis, the division struggled with reduced morale and desertion after the formation of the Sindrian Diktat. Nonetheless, during the Second AI War, the division collected billions of credits to fund the Hegemony's expenditures. Now, using new military technology developed on their capital planet of Chitagupta, they form the spearhead of the Hegemony's project to restore the Domain.",,,,

#Fighters with codex entries,,,,,,
eis_peacekeeper,SHIP,"The Peacekeeper is an advanced space superiority interceptor design in use by Iron Shell. Armed with a downscaled Devastator Cannon as well as a pair of anti-fighter missile launchers, this interceptor excels against enemy fighters. As their Delta-level AI processing cores are fine-tuned for targeting and hunting enemy fighters, Peacekeepers are less effective against conventional warships.
 
 The Peacekeeper interceptor is an infrequent sight in Iron Shell fleets for a multitude of reasons. They require that a single highly-skilled pilot directly interfaces with the fighter's Delta-level AI, something that very few human pilots are willing to do. Furthermore, long-term use of the AI synchronization system has been shown to cause mental instability in some pilots who, having grown so accustomed to their link with the AI subprocessor, struggle to make sense of reality out of the cockpit. Because of these problems, mandatory weekly flight hour limitations are required to allow Peacekeeper pilots time to reacclimate. Luddic pilots are not allowed to command these fighters to prevent political issues from arising with the Luddic Church. Because of these considerations, the duty of piloting the Peacekeeper is offered to only the best pilots employed by the Hegemony. Those few pilots brave (or foolish) enough to pilot the fighter are a rare commodity indeed.	",,,,
eis_dagger,SHIP,"A precursor to what is now known as the Dagger torpedo bomber, the Fourteenth Battlegroup variant of the Dagger strike craft utilizes a modified Hammer torpedo that has a larger, more unstable payload, as well as a point-defense screen of light Annihilator rockets that are launched as the Hammer approaches its target. As a result, the Dagger (XIV) has a higher damage potential than conventional Dagger bombers but relies on close-in tactics to accurately strike its target.

An experimental predecessor to the Atropos-wielding Dagger bomber, the Dagger (XIV) was beset by many technical issues that ultimately resulted in the bomber being unused until its more successful high-tech variant was perfected during the Expansion era. Their Hammer torpedos tended to drift off course from their intended target, and initial prototypes of the Annihilator PD screen proved to be unreliable. Although few forge templates were ever made for the Dagger prototype, one eventually found its way into the hands of an enterprising Iron Shell engineer, who promptly set to work trying to fix the defective bomber. After much trial and error, the engineer managed to correct the numerous problems plaguing the prototype; at long last, the experimental bomber was ready for use by the Hegemony. Quickly adopted by Iron Shell carrier battlegroup commanders, the incredible power of the bomber's Hammer torpedo perfectly supplemented the powerful bomber payloads typical to Hegemony fleets.",,,,

eis_talon,SHIP,"Before the Defense of Chicomoztoc, this craft was developed in an attempt to mitigate the heavy casualties associated with the regular Talon strike craft. To preserve their pilots (primarily conscripted civilians and prospective officer candidates), the Hegemony Navy produced a Talon derivative equipped with improved armor at the cost of wing size.

eis_audacious,SHIP,"Essentially a miniaturized Vengeance, the Audacious-class destroyer was designed in tandem with the Vengeance-class as a companion carrier and nimble escort vessel. Lacking a Vengeance Core due to space constraints, the Audacious is able to piggyback off a deployed Vengeance Core-equipped vessel to increase the efficiency of its shields, the performance of its engines, and its peak performance time.",,,,
eis_flagellator,SHIP,"Equipped with upgraded dampener systems, a modular hangar, as well as a pair of medium composite hardpoints, the XIV Battlegroup adaption of the Flagellator-class destroyer is more than capable of facing whatever threats the enemies of the Hegemony can throw at it.

Built for speed, the Flagellator is a dedicated hunter-killer designed to chase down and eliminate fast targets.",,,,
eis_vengeance,SHIP,"Designed with one purpose in mind, the first Vengeance-class ships were deployed in high-priority engagements against rogue Domain Explorarium drones. The Vengeance is equipped with an unusual set of subsystems known collectively as the 'Vengeance Core', allowing the ship to create concussive blasts that deflect missiles and send them straight back at the enemy while reinforcing its shields. This, combined with its two flight decks, drones, and generous main armament make the Vengeance a strong counter to the missile-heavy fleets of the Explorarium. It is also, perhaps as an afterthought, quite effective against any post-Collapse commanders that become too missile-happy for the Hegemony's liking.",,,,
eis_indomitable,SHIP,"The Indomitable-class cruiser was designed to be a more agile, offense-oriented companion to the Dominator. While it may lack the former's staying power, it can still take quite a beating with careful use of its Rampage Drive, a combination of a dampener field and the brief activation of a burn drive.",,,,
eis_mora,SHIP,"Before their retirement from service in the Domain Navy, Mora-class carriers were extensively used by the Fourteenth Battlegroup. While many of these ships had layouts and configurations similar to the contemporary, remilitarized Mora, a select few received upgrades to match the fleet doctrine of the Fourteenth Battlegroup, utilizing a heavier ballistic complement to outlast the Battlegroup's enemies. Despite the mass decommissioning of the Domain's stock of Mora-class cruisers in favor of nimbler carriers like the Heron, the Mora (XIV) continued to see usage within the Fourteenth Battlegroup, never quite leaving service despite several shifts in fleet doctrine.",,,,
eis_eradicator,SHIP,"Back in the long cycles of the Domain, an embarrassing demonstration of the ship in the core sector allowed a discreet transfer of these fast cruisers over to the Fourteenth Battlegroup. The resilient design of the Eradicator was improved by the engineers of the Battlegroup to feature a missile microforge allowing its production to deliver a decisive blow to its enemies.",,,,
eis_endeavor,SHIP,"Proponents of newer schools of thought in the Domain's 'decisive battle' doctrine criticized the Legion for being too specialized and inflexible in its role. After years of heated debate, these criticisms led to the commissioning of the Endeavor class of battlecarriers. Derived from an older prototype version of the Legion, the Endeavor features significantly increased baseline engine performance, a Jump Thruster system for versatile mobility, and a compact missile microforge. As a result, the Endeavor is much more suited to extended frontline engagements than its lumbering counterpart, but this comes at the cost of the Legion's armor plating and fighter bay capacity.",,,,
eis_tyrant,SHIP,"Despite its abandonment by the Fourteenth Battlegroup prior to the Collapse, the Tyrant (XIV) proved to be the ideal testing ground for House Celeste's Aquila Reactor Protocol. By combining its high mobility with a groundbreaking system for weaponizing flux, the Tyrant (XIV) is a mainstay in Iron Shell fleets as a spearhead that breaks through enemy lines.

The Tyrant (XIV) was intended to replace the Onslaught as the Fourteenth's primary ship of the line, using its superior mobility and diverse strike package to win engagements instead of the heavy armor and frontal firepower of the Onslaught. Instead, the Fourteenth Battlegroup-spec armor plating slowed the Tyrant down, effectively turning it into a lightly armored, poorly armed Onslaught. The project was deemed a failure and all Tyrant (XIV) prototypes destroyed.

In the years after the First AI War, House Celeste was able to acquire the old Tyrant (XIV) blueprints during its scramble to maintain its position in the Hegemony's hierarchy. Using it as a testbed for the groundbreaking Aquila Reactor, House Celeste used its advanced flux management qualities to turn the Tyrant's antiquated flux dispersal system into a weapon of war. Its mobility was also increased despite the Tyrant (XIV)'s armor advantage over its baseline counterpart. The result is a fearsome weapon of war that is used extensively by the Hegemony Ministry of Commerce and Iron Shell to protect the state and punish tax evaders.",,,,
,,,,,,
#Ships with codex entries,,,,,,
eis_valorous,SHIP,"The Valorous is an advanced frigate design that, while expensive to manufacture and deploy, has unrivaled effectiveness against most vessels. The Valorous is incredibly fast and powerful for a ship of its size due to its Zandatsu mobility system and twin medium hardpoints. The only limiting factors on this frigate's combat effectiveness are its relative fragility and the skills of its pilot.

The Valorous owes its daunting combat ability to a suite of highly specialized systems, the foremost of which are referred to as the ""Zandatsu Subsystems"". Iron Shell officials have publicly stated that the ship utilizes an array of Delta-level AI cores; how their engineers were able to work past the lack of computational power apparent to Delta AIs and other problems inherent to multi-core AI clusters remains to be seen.

The creation of the Valorous is shrouded in mystery. For such an advanced vessel, there is precious little information available regarding its design. What is known seems to suggest that the Valorous is a pre-Collapse prototype that was never properly developed due to an abundance of issues that were only recently solved by Iron Shell's research and development division. Earlier attempts by Hegemony engineers resulted in two individuals being incarcerated on Yami for attempting to utilize a Gamma level AI core in the ship. Unfortunately, these attempts failed, as even the computational power of a Gamma-level AI proved to be insufficient in dealing with the complexities of the Zandatsu systems.

Few Valorous frigates exist at any given moment, and there are even fewer pilots skilled enough to unleash their full potential. Pilots of these ships are typically esteemed Peacekeeper interceptor aces familiar with the neural interface required to pilot the vessel. The pilot handles piloting and three-dimensional maneuvering, while the AI handles mundane things such as shield and targeting solution optimizations, managing the vessel's two Gunblade drones, multiple minor subsystems, and the use of the Zandatsu subsystems.",,,,
eis_courageous,SHIP,"A fast, aggressive frigate that excels at dueling ships of similar size, the Courageous is entirely forward-focused and relies on its agility and drones for point defense. Its powerful thrusters and versatile Gunblade drones are invaluable in combat, though it is more expensive to deploy and service than typical frigates.

Built as a response to widespread adoption of the Centurion by rebel fleets, Courageous-class frigates use their speed to set the terms of engagement and have the weapons complement needed to overpower most other frigates. The Hegemony prizes its integrated Gunblade drones, which serve a similar role to the infamous Terminators without their potentially dangerous AI guidance systems.",,,,
eis_champion,SHIP,"The first time a Hegemony officer laid eyes on a Champion was during the First AI War. The heavy cruiser was a formidable opponent, and the sudden introduction of a new ship into the Persean Sector was cause for alarm. While the cruiser itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the ability of the League to develop new warships prompted an immediate investigation into the warship. Reading into the history of the vessel, Hegemony officials were convinced that they had been cheated. The Champion, in their eyes, was meant for the Fourteenth Battlegroup and its plans rightfully theirs. 

A sense of wounded pride developed in the officers of the Hegemony, growing into a wave of revanchism that reached its peak when several of the cruisers were recovered after a battle with the Persean League. House Celeste, out of favor with Hegemony leadership after the devastation of the First AI War and looking for a way back into the High Hegemon's good graces, acquired these ships and overhauled them to match Hegemony doctrine. The design of the Champion was upgraded with salvaged Fourteenth Battlegroup materiel and modified to better fit Hegemony naval doctrine. In particular, the ship's turrets and subsystems support a wider array of weaponry while the built-in Annihilation Protocol allows the Champion (XIV) to overcharge its weapons systems beyond their original capabilities. Bedecked in Fourteenth Battlegroup livery, the retrofitted Champion shows that the Hegemony's best days are not behind it.
 
The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful weapons; the crowning element is a heavy hybrid turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust power grid capable of supercharging the ship's weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash crippling strikes without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.	  
 ",,,,
eis_skyrend,SHIP,"A recent addition to Iron Shell and Hegemony fleets, the Skysplitter (XIV) represents the perfection of House Celeste's Annihilation Protocol system and is a fast, powerful frontline combatant. Paired with a proper escort, its massive frontal firepower can overpower enemy capital craft with ease. The relatively uncommon Skysplitter (XIV) is now the scalpel to the Onslaught's hammer, finding a home in special forces and expeditionary tax assessment fleets throughout the Hegemony's sphere of influence.

Flush with credits after the success of their Champion (XIV) refit, House Celeste engineers sought a larger midline hull to convert to Fourteenth Battlegroup spec for procurement by the Hegemony Navy. They settled on the Skysplitter, a relatively uncommon pocket battleship that sacrifices armor and hull integrity for extreme frontal firepower and flux dissipation. After improving the ship's armor and ballistic loadout, House Celeste's engineers determined that the oversized flux capacitors on the ship could be used to power a perfected version of the Champion (XIV)'s Annihilation Protocol. Despite several (tax-deductible) lab accidents, the researchers in charge of the project succeeded in producing what many consider to be the most overtuned vessel in the Fourteenth Battlegroup's arsenal. 

While the advanced materials used in its construction prevent the Skysplitter (XIV) from being fielded widely in Hegemony fleets, Iron Shell's nimbler navy uses them frequently and to great effect. As a result, tax cheats around the sector now regularly find themselves staring down 14 barrels of concentrated firepower. The few who decide not to pay up don't tend to last long before the Skysplitter (XIV) lives up to its name.",,,,

#Weapons,,,,,,
eis_dualrailgun,WEAPON,"Larger version of the railgun, the twin-linked counterpart retains its effectiveness against shield generators while having the capability for a faster firing rate. Electronic interferences of such capability create slight inaccuracy when used.",,,,
eis_lunarrose,WEAPON,"Launches a MIRV that splits into multiple EMP-less sabots when close to its target. Capable of decimating shields on larger vessels.

A post-collapse design of Iron Shell's creation, the Lunar Rose makes use of a heavily-converted Hurricane MIRV platform to deliver several modified Sabot missiles to its target. Devised to make up for some of the shortcomings of their conventional counterparts, 'Lunar Sabots' have a much higher effective range as well as greatly improved velocity. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of the missile's EMP capabilities. The end result is a truly fearsome weapon, obliterating all but the strongest of shields.",,,,
eis_infernal_star,WEAPON,"A shotgun of gargantuan proportions, the Infernal Star fires multiple underpowered Hellbore rounds in a fixed pattern. While unable to charge its plasma shells to their full potential, the Infernal Star makes up for this shortcoming through its sheer volume of firepower. Has a lengthy reload and charging period.",,,,

eis_milf,WEAPON,A medium-ranged beam with short burst that causes devastating damage to armor.,,,,
#Built-In Weapons,,,,,,
eis_fluxthrower,WEAPON,"A colossal prototype energy weapon demanding the majority of the Tyrant's length to accommodate. The so-called ""Fluxthrower"" stores accumulated flux in special capacitors before unleashing a lethal stream of superheated electroplasma.

While now used as a weapon, the Flux Thrower was originally built into Tyrant as an attempt to circumvent the limitations of flux cores of the time, as the ship's heavy armor plating and primitive chassis bottlenecked its ability to vent flux. To compensate, several massive capacitors were linked directly to the flux core, which could vent through a large, dedicated port more rapidly than the ship could through traditional, distributed venting. While the system never caught on due to the space required and concerns about creating structural weaknesses on other vessels, it was retained in the Tyrant (XIV) due to its difficulty in removal. In time, Tyrant (XIV) crews came to appreciate the Fluxthrower's terrifying effectiveness as an impromptu weapon.",,,,
