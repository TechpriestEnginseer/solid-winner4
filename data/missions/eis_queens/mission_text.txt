Location: An unspecified location in the Naraka system
Date: 192.05.11

The Second AI War is in full swing. With the Hegemony stretched thin and outmaneuvered, its main defense fleet around Nachiketa is caught off-guard and swiftly destroyed. With orders to avoid facing capture at all costs, the Hegemony-appointed magistrate prepares the AM reserves for a tactical purge in order to destroy the arriving Tri-Tachyon invaders.

The Hegemony SIGINT outpost on the planet discovers a small reconnaissance force tapped into the local communications array. Rather than have their plans leaked and lose their chance to repel the invasion, they order Officer Ava Nitia to pilot a secret prototype vessel to intercept and destroy the spies before they can warn the rest of the fleet about the trap.
