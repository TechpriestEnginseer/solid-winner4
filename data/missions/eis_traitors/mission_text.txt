Location: In orbit around Sindria in the Askonia System.
Date: 181.xx.xx

Opis is destroyed by a Planet Killer. For his erratic and ill-judged actions, Admiral Andrada, Hero of the Battle of Maxios, is ordered to report to the Hegemony executive council immediately. He ignores the order and initiates purges throughout Askonia, proclaiming himself executor-for-life. Most of the Hegemony intervention fleet present in Askonia follow suit, declaring their allegiance to the new executor.

A minority of the intervention fleet still remains steadfastly loyal to the Hegemony, including a young officer by the name of Darren Hartley. A chaotic battle breaks out in the Hegemony armada in orbit around Sindria, with fighting both in ship corridors and between ships of the Hegemony fleet.

Hartley and his peers cannot stay as Andrada conducts his purges. They must make a breakthrough through a weak point in the rearguard of the traitorous fleet and escape with the few remaining loyalists.
