eis_champion,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful weapons; the crowning element is a heavy hybrid turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust power grid capable of supercharging the ship's weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash a crippling strikes without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.

The first time a Hegemony officer laid eyes on a Champion was at the start of the AI wars. The powerful heavy cruiser was a formidable opponent, and the seeming introduction of a new ship into the Persean Sector was cause for alarm; while the cruiser itself was nothing out of the ordinary, the possibility of the League being able to develop new warships prompted an immediate investigation. Reading in to the history of the vessel, Hegemony officials became convinced that they had been cheated, that the Champion had been meant for the 14th Battlegroup, its plans, rightfully theirs. A sense of wounded pride developed in the officers, growing into a wave of revanchism that reached its peak when several of the cruisers were recovered after a battle with the Persean League. The ambitious officers concocted a plan to reclaim what they believed to be their stolen glory. The design was upgraded with salvaged Fourteenth Battlegroup material and modified to better fit Hegemony naval doctrine; in particular, the ship's turrets and subsystems were modified to support a wider array of weaponry. Bedecked in Fourteenth Battlegroup livery, the retrofitted Champion is designed to show the Hegemonyâ€™s best days are not behind it.",,,
